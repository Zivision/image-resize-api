*  About
This project is about building a concurrent API.
It will take requests and perform operations on them such as resize, compress, and change color.

*  Main Goals for Version One
**  TODO Setup Gin project
**  TODO Build Endpoints to accept image
+  NOTE: probably a simple put and get endpoint for now.
**  TODO Build logic to manipulate file
+  NOTE: It will do just one process for version one
**  OPTIONAL Might add docker container if needed
**  TODO Write tests and test code
**  TODO Deploy to render
*  End of version one roadmap
Will add more goals and plans as the project develops
